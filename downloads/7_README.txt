Code Instructions:

We'll define the following table:
0
1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8 9
...

You are asked to write a code which returns the table's value at row x and column y (also, note that y<=x MUST apply).
To make things easier, let's say the table starts at row 0 column 0.
The password for the ZIP, is the table's value at x = 6913374202222 and y = 420691337222.
